#Keyboard Layout Cheatsheet
###Autor: Volker Otto


###Description:
Ever needed to see all avaiable keyboard controls/shortcuts for a game?
Im starting to build keyboard layout cheatsheets for popular games. You can print them out, modify and share them if you like. (Just not sell!)

Still have no idea what this is? Take a look at 'bf3.jpg' as an example.

You you'd like to contribute, simple download the Template.psd (or fork it). It is filled with all the layers/colors you will need. When finished - simple make a pull request and I will add them to the collection.
