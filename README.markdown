###Description:
Ever needed to see all available keyboard controls/shortcuts for a game? Im sure you spend some hours figuring out which key does what in the control settings menu.

Im starting to build keyboard layout cheatsheets for popular games. So you can print them out or just leave them open on your second monitor while you are gaming.

You can also start to create your own, modify or share them if you like (just not sell, okay?!)

Still have no idea what this is? Take a look at 'bf3.jpg' as an example.

Well isn't that great? You see right away which keys to use for moving or combat and even more. No more looking into the control settings while in-game.

You you'd like to contribute, simple download the Template.psd (or fork it). It is filled with all the layers/colors you will need. When finished - simple make a pull request and I will add them to the collection.

###Template

The template looks like this:

As you can see, it is empty. Surprise!
Just show the 'Overlay' folder in Photoshop and you will see some example texts and overlays.
Always use the font: Helvetica Neue in 30-35px
Always use the right colors for overlays and put them in the right folder (so others can easily find what you did).


###FAQ

**What keyboard is this?**
It's the Steelseries 6Gv2!
