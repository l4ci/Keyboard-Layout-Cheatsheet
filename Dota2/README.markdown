This cheatsheet is only valid, if you are using the autoexec.cfg and config_keybindings.cfg also in this folder.
Don't know what these files are? [Read here](http://www.killsteal-legends.net/dota-2-tweaked-config.html)

Note: This config is based on the Killsteal-legends config, but it's modified for (imoo) better keyboard handling.
